Welcome to RobotBP's documentation!
===================================
BPRobot is a library for programming Lego Mindstorms with [Behavioral Programming](https://github.com/bThink-BGU/BPjs-Context).

The BP code can be on a Lego EV3 brick with an ev3dev sd-card, or on a remote computer/Raspberry PI and control the EV3 through bluetooth.

When running on a Raspberry PI, the program can also control [Grove-PI](https://www.dexterindustries.com/grovepi/) devices.

If you are new to BPjs you can learn from the tutorial in: `BPjs tutorial <https://bpjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
